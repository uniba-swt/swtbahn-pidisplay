# swtbahn-pidisplay
The Raspberry Pi on an SWTbahn platform is intended to be run without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse attached. Thus, the IP address of the Raspberry Pi needs to be known in order to interact with the platform. To aid this, a small digital display is attached to each Raspberry Pi to display its IP address. The following displays are used on the SWTbahn platforms:
*  SWTbahn Lite: [Waveshare 2.13 inch e-paper HAT (version 1)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT)
*  SWTbahn Standard: [Waveshare 2.13 inch e-paper HAT (version 2)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT)
*  SWTbahn Full: [Display-o-Tron HAT](https://github.com/pimoroni/displayotron)
